Map Anomaly Detection for Curious Robots

## What is Quirkd?

Quirkd is a series of nodes for the Robot Operating System (ROS) ecosystem that perform anomaly detection for mobile robots. One or more robots feed sensor information into a time series of maps that compare maps to identify moving objects or objects that are out of place on a map.
